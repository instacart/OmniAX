# OmniAX
OmniAX is a thin wrapper around Apple's UIAccessibility framework, meant to modernize accessibility syntax and substantially simplify the process of making your app accessible. To ALL users.

## Why?
At Instacart, we strongly believe in making apps accessible to everyone. We _also_ understand how difficult it can be to allocate development resources to this task at a young company. Understandably, many companies are focused completely on survival —— building out features to ensure their product is invaluable to their core group of users.

The UIAccessibility framework does an excellent job providing developers with extensive tools so they can ensure their apps work well for everyone. However, it's also widely understood that the UIAccessibility APIs are somewhat cumbersome, rather verbose and, quite simply, require a lot of effort to work well.

We created OmniAX to make this whole process a bit easier.
